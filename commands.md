# Commands

In VSCode, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette and type `VSC Links` to see the available commands.

## Create Config File
This command will create a new configuration file in your workspace. You can then add your custom links to this file. If you use a `.ts` file make sure to install the types with `npm add -D vscl`, or just remove the imports if you dont want the types.

## Restart
If the extension is not working as expected, you can try restarting it with this command.
